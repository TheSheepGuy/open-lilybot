# Open Lilybot

A Discord bot that renders Lilypond code using Node.js. This is not meant as a complete replacement for a Lilypond installation, but instead a tool to be used when a snippet of music is to be shared.

## Requirements

* A Unix-like system. This has currently been tested only on Arch Linux and will most likely not work on Windows without modifying the code. That said, you can edit the code as you wish on your machine to make it work.
* [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js). Used to interact with Discord. Install this using npm (run `npm install discord.js` in the directory where the bot is located).
* [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/index.html). Used to compile Lilypond code. Install this like any other software (e.g. on Arch Linux, `pacman -S lilypond`).

## Installation

There is no link to invite "the bot", instead the code that makes the bot work is presented here â€” think of it like how you can't drive a motor, but how you can put the motor in a car to drive the car, you can't use the code that's here, but you can create your bot with this code. This is due to it executing commands in the terminal which isn't supported by certain server hosting services, and because it requires Lilypond, which isn't provided in the NPM. Instead, you should do the following:

* Create a new bot yourself by going to Discord's Developer Portal.
* Copy the token and paste it to token.txt in the same directory as the where the bot (`bot.js`) is located.
* If not already done, install Lilypond, and run `npm install discord.js` in the same directory.
* Run `node bot.js` in your favourite terminal.

## Configuration

Currently, the following can be configured by editing the `config.json` file. Editing the JSON file should be straight forward, even for people with little experience with JSON.

* The prefix used. By default, this is `$lilypond`.

## Usage

Open Lilybot is designed to work just like regular Lilypond does from the terminal. That means to compile some Lilypond code, you should type ``$lilypond ```\relative { c' d e f g a b c }```
``. You can't upload a Lilypond file due to security reasons, that isn't the purpose for this bot anyway.

Extra options can be passed as usual (with the exception of `--output`). Note, however, that *only the most recent file is uploaded*! That means that using `-dpreview` will not upload a PDF and a PNG file, but only a PNG.

### Custom options

These options exist only for this bot and not in Lilypond. After having typed out your Lilypond code, further options can be typed:

* `$$verbose`, or `$v`: Show the output of Lilypond's compiling process. This is hidden by default to not clog up the chat.

## Future additions

* Add a MIDI functionality that renders MIDI output to more easily demonstrate musical examples. It should render the MIDI produced by Lilypond and then upload a lossy file (MP3 or OGG depending on which is easier and quicker). This should be optional so that if the bot maintainer doesn't want to go through the steps to enable MIDI rendering they can decide to simply remove it. Possible candidates for this functionality:
  * Fluidsynth. This could work well but is another program that needs to be run from the terminal. The bot maintainer would need to set it up with the appropriate soundfont too, requiring a lot more installation steps.
